## 1. Introduction
R端veyda is an entrepeneur from Deventer with her own eyelashes salon. Lash Room Deventer was erected in 2022 and has been a staple in beauty and self-care in Deventer ever since.
Like almost every business owener, R端veyda needed a website to further familiarize the public with her business. This webapp was developed using the VueJS framework, creating a
sophisticated Single Page Application with custom components that suited R端veyda's needs the most. This repository houses all written code, unit/e2e tests and documentation to
further develop the SPA.

## 2. Vue SPA
The SPA was built using the VueJS framework, a popular JavaScript webapplication framework. It uses a number of custom components to keep redundant and boilerplate code to a minimum.
These components will be described here.

### 2.1 Banner component
Bascially every webapplication has a banner. This banner contains Lash Room Deventer's logo, a navigation bar to different routes* and contact information. This banner component was
designed to shrink when a user scrolls further into the webapp. It also permanently sticks to the top of the screen to keep important information on-screen at all times.
